### Hi there 👋

PublicPolicyCodes is a profile made by me, Ji Yeon Kim, a second year MPA student at Columbia University. 
I named my github  ✨ PublicPolicyCodes✨  hoping that I can upload useful codes to help people make better public policy decisions based on data.

If you have any issues with my codes, please reach out to me at jk4559@columbia.edu. ☺️
