### Hi there 👋

PublicPolicyCodes is a profile made by me, Ji Yeon Kim, a recent graduate of the MPA program at Columbia University. 
I named my github 🍄 PublicPolicyCodes 🍄  hoping that I can upload useful codes to help people make better public policy decisions based on data.

If you have any questions about my codes, please reach out to me at jk4559@columbia.edu.
